In mathematics, the degree of polynomials in one variable is the highest power of the variable in the algebraic expression with non-zero coefficient.

Chef has a polynomial in one variable x with N terms. The polynomial looks like A0⋅x0+A1⋅x1+…+AN−2⋅xN−2+AN−1⋅xN−1 where Ai−1 denotes the coefficient of the ith term xi−1 for all (1≤i≤N).

Find the degree of the polynomial.

Note: It is guaranteed that there exists at least one term with non-zero coefficient.

Input Format
First line will contain T, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
First line of each test case contains of a single integer N - the number of terms in the polynomial.
Second line of each test case contains of N space-separated integers - the ith integer Ai−1 corresponds to the coefficient of xi−1.
Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line, the degree of the polynomial.
